# SillyTavern-CharacterName

Silly little extension to fix an issue I keep having. Sometimes creators make alternative scenes or situations of the same character and I have trouble knowing which one is which. This issue is pretty predominant if you like JanitorAI character for example. This way you can name them whatever you want and keep `{{char}}` with the actual character name. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Installation

copy the github URL on SillyTaver extension tab, press `Install Extension` button at the top right corner

```
https://github.com/phampyk/SillyTavern-CharacterName
```

## How to use

Once the extension is installed you have a new field on the character panel

When you use {{char}} the new name will show up, that's what the AI will see despite the name of your card, this screenshot shows `Hello, I'm {{char}}`

> This extension has been created with Claude. Vibecoded if you will. If you don't trust it, you don't like it or you don't support it is absolutely fine, this was to scratch my own itch more than anything and I use it myself.
